    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 2025-02-23</p>

    <p>Volodymyr Prokhorovych ("I," "me," "my," or "mine") provides this Privacy Policy (this "Policy") to describe the types of information I collect from you ("users," "your," or "you") when you use my website available at [Insert your website address here] or any game I provide on a mobile platform (each a "Service," collectively, the "Services").</p>

    <p>My Privacy Policy tells you what <strong>personal data</strong> and <strong>non-personal data</strong> I collect from you, how I collect them, how I protect them, how I share them, how you can access and change them, and how you can limit my sharing of them. The Privacy Policy also explains certain legal rights that you have with respect to your personal data.</p>

    <h2>Information I Collect from You</h2>

    <p>I do not collect any Personal Information like email address, birth date or time, age, name, phone number, or address from users.</p>

    <h2>Support requests or direct communication</h2>

    <p>If I do happen to obtain personal information, including emails or phone numbers, through support requests or other correspondence, it will be treated with the strictest confidentiality.

        <li>Unique device identifiers for advertising (e.g., Google Advertiser ID or IDFA)</li>
        <li>Device information</li>
        <li>Geography/region</li>
        <li>Number of users</li>
        <li>Number of sessions</li>

    </ul>

    <p>I use such data to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Analyze gameplay data, improve the content, and track potential problems or trends with my Games and services, or to test my new game features and content.</li>
        <li>Understand you and your preferences and provide you with new game content and services, and tailor my products.</li>
        <li>Provide game updates, technical troubleshooting, understanding and analyzing trends in connection with usage of the Games, and administering the Games.</li>
        <li>Deliver advertisements and promotional information to you in my Apps.</li>
        <li>Cross-promote my Apps and services, meaning I may promote one of my Apps while you are playing a different App of mine.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sale of Personal Data and Successors</h2>

    <p>I do not sell your personal data to third parties, and I do not intend to do so in the future.</p>
